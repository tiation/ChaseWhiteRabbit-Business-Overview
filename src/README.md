# Source Code Directory

This directory contains all application source code organized by functionality.

## Structure

- `app/` - Main application entry points and routing
- `components/` - Reusable UI components and business logic components
- `services/` - Business logic, API clients, and external service integrations
- `utils/` - Utility functions and helper modules
- `types/` - Type definitions and interfaces

## Development Standards

- Follow established coding conventions and style guides
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Write comprehensive unit tests for all modules
- Use meaningful names for files, functions, and variables
- Maintain proper separation of concerns

## Code Organization

- Group related functionality together
- Use barrel exports (index.js/ts files) for clean imports
- Keep components small and focused on single responsibilities
- Document complex business logic with inline comments
