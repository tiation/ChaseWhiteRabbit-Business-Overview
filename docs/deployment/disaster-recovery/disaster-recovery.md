# Disaster Recovery Strategies for ChaseWhiteRabbit

## Overview
Disaster recovery strategies are vital to ensuring business continuity in the event of failures or disasters. This document provides guidelines and procedures to manage backups, data restoration, and site failover.

## Backups

### Regular Backup Procedures
- Automated daily backups of all critical data, including databases, configuration files, and persistent storage, are scheduled.
- Backups are encrypted and stored in multiple geographic locations to ensure accessibility in case of regional outages.

### Backup Retention
- Backups are retained for a minimum of 30 days, with older backups being archived for up to a year for historical reference.

### Notification
- Alerts are sent to `tiatheone@protonmail.com`, `garrett@sxc.codes`, and `garrett.dillman@gmail.com` upon successful completion or failure of backup jobs.

## Data Restoration Procedures

### Restoration Process
- Identify the backup file based on the date and components needed.
- Use the backup management tool to restore data to a pre-production environment to verify its integrity.
- After verification, restore the data to the production environment.

### Testing
- Semi-annual verification of backup data integrity and restoration processes.
- Perform disaster recovery drills to familiarize the team with procedures and ensure adherence to SLAs.

## Site Failover

### Failover Conditions
- Site failover is initiated if the primary site experiences prolonged downtime or severe service degradation exceeding 30 minutes.

### Failover Plan
- Ensure all systems in secondary environments are kept up to date and in synchronization with primary systems.
- Route traffic to secondary environments using DNS updates, maintaining service continuity.
- Continuously monitor the status of primary and secondary environments.

### Communication
- Immediate communication with team members, stakeholders, and users regarding failover status and estimated time to resolution.
