- No monitoring or observability frameworks
- Vulnerability to unexpected traffic spikes during major gaming events
- Lack of automated backup and disaster recovery procedures

**Business Risks:**
- Complete service disruption risk during server failures
- Inability to scale for growing user base
- Manual processes limiting development velocity
- No security scanning or compliance frameworks
- Potential reputation damage from performance issues

**Community Impact:**
- 10,000+ daily active users depending on platform reliability
- Critical component in online D&D sessions and tournaments  
- Strong community advocacy requiring careful change management
- User expectation of consistent sub-100ms response times
