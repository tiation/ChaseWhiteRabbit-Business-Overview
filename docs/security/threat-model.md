# Threat Model

## Overview
This document outlines the potential threats to our system, the attack vectors that may be exploited, and the mitigations we have implemented.

## Identified Threats
- Unauthorized access to system resources
- Data leaks due to misconfigured services
- Malware attacks
- Insider threats

## Attack Vectors
- Phishing attacks
- DDoS attacks targeting our infrastructure
- Exploitation of application vulnerabilities
- Unauthorized API access

## Mitigations
- **Authorization and Authentication**: Implement strong authentication mechanisms and enforce RBAC.
- **Data Encryption**: Use TLS/SSL for data in transit and encryption for data at rest.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep all systems and software updated to protect against vulnerabilities.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems**: Deploy systems to monitor and alert on suspicious activities.
- **Employee Training**: Regular training on security best practices and threat awareness.

## Continuous Review
The threat model should be reviewed and updated quarterly to reflect new insights and changes in our infrastructure.
