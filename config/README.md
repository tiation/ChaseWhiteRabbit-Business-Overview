# Configuration Directory

This directory contains all configuration files for different environments and services.

## Structure

- `environments/` - Environment-specific configuration files (dev, staging, prod)
- `secrets/` - Secret management templates and configurations (never store actual secrets)
- `monitoring/` - Monitoring and observability configurations

## Security Guidelines

- Never commit actual secrets or sensitive data
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Provide `.example` files for secret templates
- Follow principle of least privilege for configurations

## Environment Management

Each environment should have its own configuration file following the naming convention:
- `development.yaml`
- `staging.yaml`
- `production.yaml`
