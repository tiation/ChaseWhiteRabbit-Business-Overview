# Run Docker container
docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 --name cwr-dev chasewhiterabbit:dev
```

Production-grade images can be deployed using `docker-compose.yml` configurations tailored for different environments.

### Running Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run security checks
./scripts/ci-cd/security-check.sh
```
