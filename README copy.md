## Mission

ChaseWhiteRabbit is an NGO focused on leveraging technology to create inclusive solutions for people with disabilities and disadvantaged communities. Our core belief is that **automation is compassion at scale** - we build tools that both save time and widen access to critical services.

### Our Values

- **Big-Heart Efficiency**: Technology should serve humanity, not the other way around
- **Radical Transparency**: We open-source everything possible and operate with full transparency
- **Prevention Over Punishment**: We design systems that address root causes, not just symptoms
- **Bandwidth Empathy**: Our solutions work for everyone, regardless of their device or connection speed
- **Learning in Public**: We share our wins and missteps so others can learn and grow
