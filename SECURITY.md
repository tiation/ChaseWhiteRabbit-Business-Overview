- **Emergency**: Contact via secure channels only

## Incident Response

### Severity Levels

**Critical**: Immediate threat to system integrity or user data
**High**: Significant security risk requiring prompt attention
**Medium**: Moderate security risk with limited impact
**Low**: Minor security concern with minimal impact

### Response Process

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and manual reporting
2. **Assessment**: Security team evaluates severity and impact
3. **Containment**: Immediate steps to limit exposure
4. **Eradication**: Root cause analysis and fixes
5. **Recovery**: Restoration of normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review and improvements

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security
- Follow secure coding practices
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Implement proper error handling
- Avoid hardcoded secrets or credentials

### Dependencies
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Review new dependencies for security issues
- Use `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
- Pin dependency versions for reproducible builds

### Container Security
- Use official base images
- Keep base images updated
- Run containers as non-root users
- Minimize container attack surface
- Scan images for vulnerabilities

## Compliance and Certifications

ChaseWhiteRabbit aims to comply with:

- **ISO 27001**: Information Security Management
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security, Availability, and Confidentiality
- **GDPR**: Data Protection and Privacy (where applicable)
- **OWASP Top 10**: Web Application Security Risks

## Security Tools and Integrations

- **Metrics**: Aggregated data retained for 1 year

## Security Updates

### Notification Channels
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Automated notifications
- **Release Notes**: Security fixes highlighted
- **Email**: Critical security updates to maintainers

### Update Process
1. **Identification**: Security vulnerability identified
2. **Assessment**: Impact and severity evaluation
3. **Development**: Fix development and testing
4. **Release**: Security patch release
5. **Communication**: User notification and guidance
